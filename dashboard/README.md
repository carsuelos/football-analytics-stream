# dashboard

React + Vite + TypeScript dashboard: live metric charts, alerts and playback controls for the match the engine is following.

```sh
pnpm dev     # or `make dashboard` from the repo root; http://localhost:5173
pnpm test    # vitest: schema contract tests (node) and UI tests (jsdom)
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck
```

It only talks to the engine, through `/api`. In development Vite proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:8000` (set `ENGINE_URL` to change it), so the engine needs no CORS.

| Path | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `src/App.tsx` | Page layout |
| `src/index.css` | Tailwind CSS entry point and theme (team colours) |
| `src/test/setup.ts` | Testing Library matchers and cleanup for the UI tests |
| `test/` | Contract tests: the shared schema fixtures against the JSON Schemas |

`src/schema/` is generated from `schema/jsonschema/` by `make gen`. Do not edit it by hand.
